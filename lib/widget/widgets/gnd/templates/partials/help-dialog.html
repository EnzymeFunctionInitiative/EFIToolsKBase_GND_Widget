				<div><b>Interactive Filtering</b></div>
				The mouse can be used to select families to filter.  To
				do this, press and hold the Ctrl key on the keyboard
				and click on a protein.  All of the PFam families that
				are associated with the protein will be highlighted.
				</p>
				<p>
				<div><b>Viewing Metadata</b></div>
				Moving the mouse over a specific protein will show a
				popup box containing metadata.  As soon as the mouse is
				moved away from the protein, the box disappears.  To
				keep the box open, click on the protein, and the box
				will remain visible until the mouse is moved over a
				different protein.
				</p>
				<p>
				<div><b>Copying Metadata</b></div>
				Clicking the copy <i class="far fa-copy"></i> icon when
				the metadata popup box is visible will copy the
				metadata to the clipboard.  This information can be
				pasted into another document for further use.
				</p>
				<p>
				<div><b>Direct Link to UniProt Data</b></div>
				The UniProt ID in the metadata popup box is a link that
				can be used to access the UniProt website for the given protein.
				</p>
				<p>
				<div><b>Changing the Window (Scale)</b></div>
				By default a maximum of 40 kbp are shown.  This window
				scale factor can be increased <i class="fas fa-search-minus"></i> or
				decreased <i class="fas fa-search-plus"
				title="1.125x"></i> by using the zoom buttons.  All
				visible diagrams wil be reloaded when using the zoom
				buttons.
				</p>
				<p>
				<div><b>Changing the Window (Gene)</b></div>
				The GND explorer can display from 1 to 20 genes on
				either side of the query gene (center, red).  This can be
				changed by clicking the "genes" drop down menu in the
				Genome Window section, and clicking the Apply button.
				</p>
				<p>
				<div><b>Updating the Filter Legend</b></div>
				Selecting a family filter makes that family, along with its
				assigned color, appear in a legend box below the "Clear Filter"
				button.  Individual families can be removed from the legend
				by moving the mouse over the color box and pressing the X
				button that appears in the color box.  For InterPro
				families, the color is not assigned, but the functionality
				is the same.
				</p>
				<p>
				<div><b>Data Export</b></div>
				{% if supports_download == "true" and is_uploaded_diagram == "false" %}
					It is possible to export a file that provides the data used to generate the diagrams.
					The data file format is SQLite, and it can be uploaded to the EFI-GNT
					tool and viewed again in the future via the <i>View Saved Diagrams</i>
					option.
					For advanced use, the file can also be opened with
					<a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/" target="_blank">DB Browser for SQLite</a>
					to manually extract data.
				{% endif %}
				</p>
				<p>
				The currently displayed diagrams can be exported to the Gene Graphics
				format and displayed using the
				<a href="https://katlabs.cc/genegraphics/" target="_blank">Gene Graphics</a>
				comparative genomics visualization tool.
