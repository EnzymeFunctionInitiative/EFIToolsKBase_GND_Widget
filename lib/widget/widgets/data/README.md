# Data Widget Documentation

## Overview
This widget is responsible for reading the requested data from a SQLite file corresponding to the GND and returning it as JSON according to several parameters. The function is called by visiting the /data endpoint and including the parameters in the query, upon which the JSON is rendered in HTML.
